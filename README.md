# Smart Multiplug

In this porject I have built a basic multiplug with 8 outputs, each output has a on/off switch, the input power also have a power switch.


This project started because I was looking for some decent multiplugs with indvidual switches that was also mountable to a table or wall, but I found nothing decent and decided to make my own.

The first version was done in a rush and did not look very professional but, it worked.

The second version had a lot more planning put into it, most notably a Sonoff POW 2 was used, this gives the ability to control the power to the device remotly, but more imporantly it gives the ability to measure voltage, current and power factor.

I wanted to make a multiplug that had 8 outputs
