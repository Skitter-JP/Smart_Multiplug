# Smart Multiplug

In this porject I have built a basic multiplug with 8 outputs, each output has a on/off switch, the input power also have a power switch.


This project started because I was looking for some decent multiplugs with indvidual switches that was also mountable to a table or wall, but I found nothing decent and decided to make my own.

The first version was done in a rush and did not look very professional but, it worked.

The second version had a lot more planning put into it, most notably a Sonoff POW 2 was used, this gives the ability to control the power to the device remotly, but more imporantly it gives the ability to measure voltage, current and power factor.

On both versions the holes were cut manually with a Dremel, a stencil was made in Google Sketchup and then a 1-1 drawing was printed.

This printed stencil was this cut and taped onto the enclourser, this was then used as my guide when cutting the boxes, this technique works really well but, cutting plastic manually is horrible and time consuming.

Below we can see the stencil that was used to cutout two LED holders, A Power Button and Input Power Connector

In this image we can see the stencil that was used in version 2, the holes for the plugs and switched have been cut, you can see that I have used masking tape to hold the stencil to the lid.

Here is a photo of me cutting the lid for version 1, this clearly shows how much plastic dust is apparent when cutting these plastic enclousers.

Here is a screenshot of the stencil in Sketchup.

## Version 1

Here are images from Version 1.

The stencil for the lid has been secured and is ready for cutting.

The holes have been cut and the swtiches/plugs have been test fitted

The plugs/switches have been mounted to the lid and the connections have been made.
A din rail was mounted to the bottom of the encloser and all connections are screwed to 3 seperate terminal blocks for Earth, Neutral and Live.

In hindsight I should of twited the cables from each plug to the connector blocks, this could of helped with the mess and maybe reduce some EMI noise.

Both completed units are version 2 are seen below mounted to my desk.

## Version 2

Here are images from Version 2.

The holes have been cut and the plugs and swtiches are being mounted

A din rail was cut and installed to the bottom arae of the enclouser, 3 Connector blocks were mounted with a Sonoff POW2.
